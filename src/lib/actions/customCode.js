    //    the same rule may have other events that are not Library Loaded or Page Bottom. This means
    //    we could see isExternal = false on the action when the event that fired the rule is
    //    a click, for example.
    // 2. When users load a library synchronously which has a rule using the Library Loaded
    //    or Page Bottom event with a Custom Code action, they expect the custom code to be written
    //    in the document immediately after the script tag that loaded the Launch library. In other
    //    words, they expect document.write to be used. When the library is loaded asynchronously,
    //    they do not have this expectation.
    // 3. Calls to document.write will be ignored by the browser if the Launch library is loaded
    //    asynchronously, even if the calls are made before DOMContentLoaded.
    // Because of ^^^, we use document.write if the Launch library was loaded synchronously
    // and the event that fired the rule is library-loaded or page-bottom. Otherwise, we know we
    // cann't use document.write and must use postscribe instead.
