// For loading the code from external files, we would have been forced to use promises.
// Calling `document.write` from inside a promise would have erased the page content inside
// Firefox and IE. The result was similar with what happens if you try to call `document.write`
// after the `DOMContentLoaded` event is fired. This issue forces us to use `postcribe` for any
// external custom code no matter if `DOMContentLoaded` event has fired or not.
